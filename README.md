# dd-tool
**Simple bash script for cloning drives and writing disk images on macOS. Does the heavy lifting with dd while keeping you safe.**


**What can I do with it?**
  - **Clone drives** - Make exact copies of external drives
  - **Write images** - Flash .img, .iso, .dmg files to drives
  - **Verify data** - Optional md5 hash checking to make sure nothing got corrupted
  - **Stay safe** - Lots of confirmations so you don't nuke the wrong drive

## Usage
```
chmod +x dd-tool.sh
sudo ./dd-tool.sh
```
